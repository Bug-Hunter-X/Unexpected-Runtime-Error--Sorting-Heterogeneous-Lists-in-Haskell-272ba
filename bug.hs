```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code snippet seems innocuous. It imports the `sort` function from `Data.List`, defines a list `xs`, sorts it using `sort`, and prints the result. However, a subtle issue might arise if the list `xs` contains elements that are not comparable according to the default ordering.

For instance, if `xs` contains a mix of `Int` and `String` values, the `sort` function will throw an error because it cannot compare these different types.
```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, "2", 3, "4", 5]
  let ys = sort xs -- Error: No instance for (Ord String) arising from a use of `sort'
  print ys
```
This will fail to compile because `String` does not have an instance of the `Ord` typeclass (for ordering) by default.  The `sort` function requires that all elements in the list implement the `Ord` typeclass.
